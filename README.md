Game Description:
Sudoku is a game that tests your math and logic skills. The game is set up in a 9 square by 9 square grid. This grid is broken up into 9 smaller 3x3 grids. In each of the small boxes there is a number ranging from 1-9. The objective is the game is to fill every box with a number. However, whhat makes the game difficult is that no numbers can overlap in each row, column, or 3x3 box. That way thhere will be no repeated numbers in the grid. For example, if there is a number 3 in one of the boxes in the top row, then there can be no other 3's in any of the other boxes in the top row. The user must completely fill out every box with a number 1-9 without breaking this rule.
