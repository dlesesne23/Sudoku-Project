# Sudoku-Project
Making a functioning Sudoku game through JavaScript.

# Game Description:
Sudoku is a game that tests your math and logic skills. The game is set up in a 9 square by 9 square grid. This grid is broken up into 9 smaller 3x3 grids. In each of the small boxes there is a number ranging from 1-9. The objective is the game is to fill every box with a number. However, whhat makes the game difficult is that no numbers can overlap in each row, column, or 3x3 box. That way thhere will be no repeated numbers in the grid. For example, if there is a number 3 in one of the boxes in the top row, then there can be no other 3's in any of the other boxes in the top row. The user must completely fill out every box with a number 1-9 without breaking this rule.

# MVP Goals
My MVP goal is to have the game ready to play and challenge people on a basic level. Sudoku is not very CSS demanding. However, it requires many different Javascript functions and logic in order to make it properly work. There are many ways someone can be wrong in their input, and I will need to make sure my functions reflects  all the proper feedback by the time the project is due. That will be the main challenge for this project.

# Stretch Goals
My stretch goals will be to make different levels of difficulty. In most of the current sudoku games for my phone, there are 3 different levels of difficulty based on how many numbers are given to you at the start of the game. One of my stretch goals will be to mke different difficulty options. Another stretch goal will be to make a nice interactive homepage, where you can track your games completed, pick a difficulty, and also track timing and the time it took to complete a game.
